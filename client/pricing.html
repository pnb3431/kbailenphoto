<h3>Deposit</h3>
<blockquote>
The 50% deposit to hold the date is NON refundable. If a customer needs to reschedule, I respectfully ask to be notified 48 or more hours prior and ask that a new session date is scheduled at the same time. If the session is canceled by the customer, the 50% deposit will not be refunded. Weather cannot be controlled. Photo session will go on if it is not raining. Of course I would work with you if the weather is just plain nasty. As the photographer, I reserve the right to reschedule should unforeseen circumstances arise. Should the customer cancel more than 2 times, the session will not be rescheduled and deposit NOT returned to customer.
